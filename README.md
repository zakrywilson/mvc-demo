# Model-View-Presenter Demo

A small demonstration of the model-view-presenter with Java Swing.

Simply run the script your Terminal:

`> ./run`

### What does it do

This is just a simple demo. The program simply allows the user to type text into
the text area.

• The `show` button brings up a message box with the next inside of
the text area. If no text exists inside the text area, then "No content" is
written instead.

• The `clear` button clears the text area.
